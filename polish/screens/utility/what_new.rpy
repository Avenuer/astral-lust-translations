There are some other new mechanics like Mina can have a hangover, refuse to get into any meaningful conversation with you, and stop working on her task. Abandoned car loot was boosted significantly, first sounds to enemy attacks were added. Check the full changelog from the link below."

For a tip, this event has a few variations, seeing it once is not enough to see everything and find the secret. It's best if you don't save for an hour before finding the secret :)"

    old "The overhaul of the Astral Lust interface has begun! Many most important menus were already adopted, or at lest partially adopted. The inventory and character menu are now a single menu, fully adopted to the new style. Items now have tooltips, and icons. The whole items system was overhauled, right clicking an item will allow you to select how many to move with a slider, you can also sort your inventory, and move all items at once with just one click! Notifications are now completely different, you can toggle two different styles in the settings. Main interface theme font - {font=fonts/FrederickatheGreat-Regular.ttf}Fredericka{/font} can also be toggled in the settings. Expandable menu icons were changed, and all menus opened with them were at least partially adopted to the new theme. Trading scene was fully adopted, with new options like showing reputation increase from the deal, some new mechanics were added to the traders too - like good profit relations bonus."
